# Labwork 2 🎩

This is a project assigned to me by my class teacher for better understanding of the C language.


## Lessons Learned 📖

- 🔭 This project was a great way of learning about different sorting algorithms, mainly the **Merge Sort algorithm**.
- 🚀 This project also taught about using **structure** and creating a custom datatype in c.

```c
// Glimpse of code from this project
struct student {
  char name[20];
  int sid;
  int height;
};
```
